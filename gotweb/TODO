TODO

- Add Prev/Next to shortlogs/logs that have more entries than
  got_max_commits_display

- Redo index header, so columns are removed when content is set to not display
  in gotweb.conf.

- Massage ALL error returns. There are some examples in the code already, but
  let's be consistent.

- Integrate kcgi error codes. Hard fail or report error? Perhaps reporting is a
  security flaw and hard fail is the better design.
