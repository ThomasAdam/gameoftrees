TODO

- Add Prev/Next to shortlogs/logs that have more entries than
  got_max_commits_display

- Alter gw_get_repo_log full_log int to type more logs output for other options,
  such as header displays for commit, commit_diff, etc.

- Discuss how much of the gitweb functionality we really need or want. A user
  can really go down an endless rabbit hole. Is it all worthwhile?

- Redo index header, so columns are removed when content is set to not display
  in gotweb.conf.

- Move pledge to each function. Only diffing needs wpath and cpath.
