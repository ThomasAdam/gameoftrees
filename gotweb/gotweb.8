.Sh NAME
.Nm gotweb
.Nd Game of Trees Git repository server for web browsers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
provides a web interface allowing Git repository contents to be viewed
with a web browser.
.Pp
.Nm
is a CGI program based on
.Xr got 1
and
.Xr kcgi 3
which is intended to run in a
.Xr chroot 2
environment in
.Pa /var/www .
The program has been designed to work out of the box with
the
.Xr httpd 8
web server in conjunction with
.Xr slowcgi 8 .
.Pp
Enabling
.Nm
requires the following steps:
.Bl -enum
.It
The
.Xr httpd.conf 5
configuration file must be adjusted to run
.Nm
as a CGI program with
.Xr slowcgi 8 .
The
.Sx EXAMPLES
section below contains an appropriate configuration file sample.
.It
httpd(8) and slowcgi(8) must be enabled and started:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
  # rcctl enable httpd slowcgi
  # rcctl start httpd slowcgi
.Ed
.It
Optionally, the run-time behaviour of
.Nm
can be configured via the
.Xr gotweb.conf 5
configuration file.
.It
Git repositories must be created at a suitable location inside the
web server's
.Xr chroot 2
environment.
These repositories should
.Em not
be writable by the user ID of the
.Xr httpd 8
server.
The default location for repositories published by
.Nm
is
.Pa /var/www/got/public .
.It
Git repositories served by
.Nm
should be kept up-to-date with a mechanism such as
.Xr git-fetch 1
or
.Xr rsync 1 ,
scheduled by
.Xr cron 8 .
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/www/got/public/ -compact

Default location for Git repositories served by
.Nm .
This location can be adjusted in the
.Xr gotweb.conf 5
configuration file.
.It Pa /var/www/cgi-bin/gotweb/gotweb
The

CGI program, statically linked for use in a
.Xr chroot 2
environment.

Directory for template files used by
.Nm .
.It Pa /var/www/cgi-bin/gotweb/libexec/

helper programs which are run by
.Nm
to read Git repositories.
.It Pa /var/www/htdocs/gotweb/
Directory containing HTML, CSS, and image files used by
.Nm .
.It Pa /var/www/tmp/
Directory for temporary files created by
.Nm .

Example configuration for httpd.conf:
.Bd -literal -offset indent

  types { include "/usr/share/misc/mime.types" }
  server "gotweb.example.com" {
  	listen on * port 80
  	root "/htdocs/gotweb"
  	location "/cgi-bin/*" {
  		root "/"
  		fastcgi
  	}
