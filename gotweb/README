Game of Trees Web (Gotweb) is a read-only web front-end for Got.

Gotweb is still under development; it is being developed exclusively
on OpenBSD and its target audience are OpenBSD developers. Gotweb is
ISC-licensed and was designed with pledge(2) and unveil(2) in mind.

Gotweb uses bare Git repositories to read versioned data and is designed to
work with httpd(8).

To compile the Gotweb tool suite on OpenBSD, run:

 $ make web
 # make web-install

This will install Gotweb and all the required files to /var/www by default.

Man page files in the Gotweb source tree can be viewed with 'man -l':

 $ man -l gotweb/gotweb.conf.5

Example configuration for httpd.conf:

ext_if = "*"

types { include "/usr/share/misc/mime.types" }

server "localhost" {
	listen on $ext_if port 80

	root "/htdocs/gotweb"

	location "/cgi-bin/*" {
		root "/"
		fastcgi
	}
	location "/*" {
		directory index "index.html"
	}
}
