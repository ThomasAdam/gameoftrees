.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an interactive read-only browser for Git repositories.
This repository format is described in
.Xr git-repository 5 .
.Pp
.Nm
supports several types of views which display repository data:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Log view
Displays commits in the repository's history.
This view is displayed initially if no
.Ar command
is specified.
.It Diff view
Displays changes made in a particular commit.
.It Blame view
Displays the line-by-line history of a file.
.It Tree view
Displays the tree corresponding to a particular commit.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
provides global and command-specific key bindings and options.
The global key bindings are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm Q
Quit
.Nm .
.It Cm q
Quit the view which is in focus.
.It Cm Tab
Switch focus between views.
.It Cm f
Toggle fullscreen mode for a split-screen view.
.Nm
will automatically use split-screen views if the size of the terminal
window is sufficiently large.
.El
.Pp
Global options must precede the command name, and are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width tenletters
.It Fl h
Display usage information.
.It Fl V
Display program version and exit immediately.
.El
.Pp
The commands for
.Nm
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width blame
.It Cm log Oo Fl c Ar commit Oc Oo Fl r Ar repository-path Oc Op Ar path
Display history of a repository.
If a
.Ar path
is specified, show only commits which modified this path.
.Pp
This command is also executed if no explicit command is specified.
.Pp
The key bindings for
.Cm tog log

Show log entries for the parent directory of the currently selected path,
unless an active search is in progress in which case
.Cm Backspace
aborts the search.
.It Cm /
Prompt for a search pattern and start searching for matching commits.
The search pattern is an extended regular expression which is matched
against a commit's author name, committer name, log message, and
commit ID SHA1 hash.
Regular expression syntax is documented in
.Xr re_format 7 .
.It Cm n
Find the next commit which matches the current search pattern.
Searching continues until either a match is found or the
.Cm Backspace
key is pressed.
.It Cm N
