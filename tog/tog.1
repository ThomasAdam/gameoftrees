.Nd Git repository browser

.Op Ar arg ...

.Nm

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an interactive read-only browser for Git repositories.
This repository format is described in
.Xr git-repository 5 .
.Pp
.Nm
supports several types of views which display repository data:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Log view
Displays commits in the repository's history.
This view is displayed initially if no
.Ar command
is specified, or if just a
.Ar path
is specified.
.It Diff view
Displays changes made in a particular commit.
.It Blame view
Displays the line-by-line history of a file.
.It Tree view
Displays the tree corresponding to a particular commit.
.It Ref view
Displays references in the repository.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
provides global and command-specific key bindings and options.
The global key bindings are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm Q
Quit
.Nm .
.It Cm q
Quit the view which is in focus.
.It Cm Tab
Switch focus between views.
.It Cm f
Toggle fullscreen mode for a split-screen view.
.Nm
will automatically use split-screen views if the size of the terminal
window is sufficiently large.
.El
.Pp
Global options must precede the command name, and are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width tenletters
.It Fl h
Display usage information.
.It Fl V, -version
Display program version and exit immediately.
.El
.Pp
The commands for
.Nm
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width blame
.It Cm log Oo Fl b Oc Oo Fl c Ar commit Oc Oo Fl r Ar repository-path Oc Op Ar path
Display history of a repository.
If a
.Ar path
is specified, show only commits which modified this path.
If invoked in a work tree, the
.Ar path
is interpreted relative to the current working directory,
and the work tree's path prefix is implicitly prepended.
Otherwise, the path is interpreted relative to the repository root.
.Pp
This command is also executed if no explicit command is specified.
.Pp
The key bindings for
.Cm tog log
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm Down-arrow, j, >, Full stop
Move the selection cursor down.
.It Cm Up-arrow, k, <, Comma
Move the selection cursor up.
.It Cm Page-down, Ctrl+f
Move the selection cursor down one page.
.It Cm Page-up, Ctrl+b
Move the selection cursor up one page.
.It Cm Enter, Space
Open a
.Cm diff
view showing file changes made in the currently selected commit.
.It Cm t
Open a
.Cm tree
view showing the tree for the currently selected commit.
.It Cm Backspace
Show log entries for the parent directory of the currently selected path,
unless an active search is in progress in which case
.Cm Backspace
aborts the search.
.It Cm /
Prompt for a search pattern and start searching for matching commits.
The search pattern is an extended regular expression which is matched
against a commit's author name, committer name, log message, and
commit ID SHA1 hash.
Regular expression syntax is documented in
.Xr re_format 7 .
.It Cm n
Find the next commit which matches the current search pattern.
Searching continues until either a match is found or the
.Cm Backspace
key is pressed.
.It Cm N
Find the previous commit which matches the current search pattern.
Searching continues until either a match is found or the
.Cm Backspace
key is pressed.
.It Cm Ctrl+l
Reload the log view with new commits found in the repository.
.It Cm B
Reload the log view and toggle display of merged commits.
The
.Fl b
option determines whether merged commits are displayed initially.
.It Cm r
Open a
.Cm ref
view listing all references in the repository.
This can then be used to open a new
.Cm log
view for arbitrary branches and tags.
.El
.Pp
The options for
.Cm tog log
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b
Display individual commits which were merged into the current branch
from other branches.
By default,
.Cm tog log
shows the linear history of the current branch only.
The
.Cm B
key binding can be used to toggle display of merged commits at run-time.
.It Fl c Ar commit
Start traversing history at the specified
.Ar commit .
The expected argument is the name of a branch or a commit ID SHA1 hash.
An abbreviated hash argument will be expanded to a full SHA1 hash
automatically, provided the abbreviation is unique.
If this option is not specified, default to the work tree's current branch
if invoked in a work tree, or to the repository's HEAD reference.
.It Fl r Ar repository-path
Use the repository at the specified path.
If not specified, assume the repository is located at or above the current
working directory.
If this directory is a
.Xr got 1
work tree, use the repository path associated with this work tree.
.El
.It Cm diff Oo Fl a Oc Oo Fl r Ar repository-path Oc Ar object1 object2
Display the differences between two objects in the repository.
Treat each of the two arguments as a reference, a tag name, or an object
ID SHA1 hash, and display differences between the corresponding objects.
Both objects must be of the same type (blobs, trees, or commits).
An abbreviated hash argument will be expanded to a full SHA1 hash
automatically, provided the abbreviation is unique.
.Pp

.Cm tog diff
are as follows:

commit.
.It Cm >, Full stop
If the diff view was opened via the log view, move to the next (older) commit.
.It Cm /
Prompt for a search pattern and start searching for matching lines.
The search pattern is an extended regular expression.
Regular expression syntax is documented in
.Xr re_format 7 .
.It Cm n
Find the next line which matches the current search pattern.
.It Cm N
Find the previous line which matches the current search pattern.
