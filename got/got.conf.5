.Sh NAME
.Nm got.conf
.Nd Game of Trees configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the run-time configuration file for
.Xr got 1 .
.Pp
.Nm
may be present in the root directory of a Git repository for
repository-wide settings, or in the
.Pa .got
meta-data directory of a work tree to override repository-wide
settings for
.Xr got 1
commands executed within this work tree.
.Pp
The file format is line-based, with one configuration directive per line.
Any lines beginning with a
.Sq #
are treated as comments and ignored.
.Pp
The available configuration directives are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic author Dq Real Name <email address>
Configure the author's name and email address for
.Cm got commit
and
.Cm got import
when operating on this repository.
Author information specified here overrides the
.Ev GOT_AUTHOR
environment variable.
.Pp
Because
.Xr git 1
may fail to parse commits without an email address in author data,
.Xr got 1
attempts to reject author information with a missing email address.
.It Ic remote Ar name Brq ...
Define a remote repository.
The specified
.Ar name
can be used to refer to the remote repository on the command line of
.Cm got fetch .
.Pp
Information about this repository is declared in a block of options
enclosed in curly brackets:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic server Ar hostname
Defines the hostname to use for contacting the remote repository's server.
.It Ic repository Ar path
Defines the path to the repository on the remote repository's server.
.It Ic protocol Ar scheme
Defines the protocol to use for communicating with the remote repository's
server.
.Pp
The following protocol schemes are supported:
.Bl -tag -width git+ssh
.It git
The Git protocol as implemented by the
.Xr git-daemon 1
server.
Use of this protocol is discouraged since it supports neither authentication
nor encryption.
.It git+ssh
The Git protocol wrapped in an authenticated and encrypted
.Xr ssh 1
tunnel.
With this protocol the hostname may contain an embedded username for
.Xr ssh 1
to use:
.Mt user@hostname
.It ssh
Short alias for git+ssh.
.El
.It Ic port Ar port
Defines the port to use for connecting to the remote repository's server.
The
.Ar port
can be specified by number or name.
The port name to number mappings are found in the file
.Pa /etc/services ;
see
.Xr services 5
for details.
If not specified, the default port of the specified
.Cm protocol
will be used.
.It Ic mirror-references Ar yes | no
This option controls the behaviour of
.Cm got fetch
when updating references.
.Sy Enabling this option can lead to the loss of local commits.
Maintaining custom changes in a mirror repository is therefore discouraged.
.Pp
If this option is not specified or set to
.Ar no ,
.Cm got fetch
will map references of the remote repository into the local repository's
.Dq refs/remotes/
namespace.
.Pp
If this option is set to
.Ar yes ,
all branches in the
.Dq refs/heads/
namespace will be updated directly to match the corresponding branches in
the remote repository.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Configure author information:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
author "Flan Hacker <flan_hacker@openbsd.org>"
.Ed
.Pp
Remote repository specification for the Game of Trees repository:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
remote "origin" {
	server git.gameoftrees.org
	protocol git
	repository got
}
.Ed
.Pp
Mirror the OpenBSD src repository from Github:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
remote "origin" {
	repository "openbsd/src"
	server git@github.com
	protocol git+ssh
	mirror-references yes
}

.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Pa got.conf
If present,
.Nm
located in the root directory of a Git repository supersedes any relevant
settings in Git's
.Pa config
file.
.Pp
.It Pa .got/got.conf
If present,
.Nm
located in the
.Pa .got
meta-data directory of a
.Xr got 1
work tree supersedes any relevant settings in the repository's
.Nm
configuration file and Git's
.Pa config
file.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr got 1 ,
.Xr git-repository 5 ,
.Xr got-worktree 5
.Sh CAVEATS
.Nm
offers no way to configure the editor spawned by
.Cm got commit ,
.Cm got histedit ,
.Cm got import ,
or
.Cm got tag .
This is deliberate and prevents potential arbitrary command execution
as another user when repositories or work trees are shared between users.
Users should set their
.Ev VISUAL
or
.Ev EDITOR
environment variables instead.
