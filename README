Got is a version control system which prioritizes ease of use and
simplicity over flexibility.

Got is being developed exclusively on OpenBSD. It is not a drop-in
replacement for other version control systems and it does not attempt
to compete with anything else than the use of any other version control
systems in the context of the OpenBSD project.
Got's target audience are OpenBSD developers, and its focus is directed
at the particular needs and use cases of the OpenBSD project.

To compile the Got tool suite on OpenBSD, run:

 $ make obj
 $ make
 $ mkdir ~/bin
 $ make install

This will install the following commands to ~/bin:

 got (command line interface)
 tog (ncurses interface)
 and several helper programs from the libexec directory

Tests will pass only after 'make install' because they rely on installed
binaries in $PATH. Tests in the cmdline directory currently depend on git(1).

 $ doas pkg_add git
 $ make regress
