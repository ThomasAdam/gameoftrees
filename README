Got is a version control system which prioritizes ease of use and
simplicity over flexibility. It is being developed exlusively on
OpenBSD and most likely won't compile on other operating systems.

To compile the Got tool suite on OpenBSD, run:

 $ make obj
 $ make
 $ mkdir ~/bin
 $ make install

This will install the following commands to ~/bin:

 got (command line interface)
 tog (ncurses interface)
 and several helper programs from the libexec directory

Tests will pass only after 'make install' because they rely on installed
libexec binaries. Tests in the cmdline directory currently depend on git(1).

 $ make regress

Man pages are not installed yet but can be viewed with mandoc:

 $ mandoc got/got.1 | less
 $ mandoc got/git-repository.5 | less
 $ mandoc tog/tog.1 | less
