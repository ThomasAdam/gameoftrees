lib:
- convert file index to RB tree and provide a depth-first iteration API
- use first-depth file index iteration when removing files during updates
  to fix empty directories left behind, and write a test for this problem
- handle checkout of trees which contain submodules by identifying and
  ignoring such tree entries; requires a .ini config parser (from isakmpd?)
