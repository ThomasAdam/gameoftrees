lib:
- handle checkout of trees which contain submodules by identifying and
  ignoring such tree entries; requires a .ini config parser (from isakmpd?)
- allow adding directory paths with 'got add'
- recursive addition: got add -R
- recursive removal: got rm -R
- fix 'got log -l1 -c fb4d85023675bc7da402da96b2bb84fd12905dbf -p';
  this command runs too slow in got-read-pack
  (maybe let got-read-pack cache ref/offset delta objects in object_cache.c?)

tog:
- allow loading new commits in 'tog log' after startup (e.g. via Ctrl-L, 'r')
- make diff view generate diffs in a background thread?
- implement horizonal scrolling in all views
- implement horizonal split view mode
- implement search feature for diff view
- implement 'limit' for 'tog log' (like search but display matched commits only)
- allow moving to prev/next blamed line in diff view if opened from blame view,
  similar to how the diff view can switch commits if opened from log view
- tog should have a command to list and log/browse references
