lib:
- improve performance of usr.bin/diff and port these changes back to got
  (e.g. diffing between versions of sys/dev/pci/pcidevs is too slow)

got:
- 'histedit -c' prompts for log message even if there are no changes to commit

tog:
- implement horizonal scrolling in all views
- implement horizonal split view mode
- implement search feature for diff view
- highlight matched parts of commits in tog log search, and then allow regular
  input to continue (such that the cursor can be moved) while tog is searching
- implement 'limit' for 'tog log' (like search but display matched commits only)
- allow moving to prev/next blamed line in diff view if opened from blame view,
  similar to how the diff view can switch commits if opened from log view
- tog should have a command to list and log/browse references
